We explored the prediction of solvation free energy using various computational models, leveraging the FreeSolv database as a benchmark dataset. The study involved implementing machine learning techniques to establish relationships between molecular structures and their solvation properties. RDKit, a robust cheminformatics toolkit, was utilized to extract molecular descriptors and generate fingerprints, which served as input features for the models. By comparing the performance of different algorithms, we aimed to identify optimal approaches for accurate and efficient solvation free energy predictions, contributing to advancements in computational chemistry and material design.
