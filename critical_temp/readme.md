The superconductivity dataset was presented in Hamidieh, Kam (2018) "A data-driven statistical model for predicting the critical temperature of a superconductor." In this paper, the author builds machine learning models to predict the critical temperature of a superconductor. The most important features, as explained in the paper, are atomic radius, valence, electron affinity and atomic mass
